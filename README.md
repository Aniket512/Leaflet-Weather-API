# Leaflet-Weather-API

The leaflet weather API is a web application that uses the OpenWeather API to display weather information of 30 cities in a paginated format with a maximum of 10 cities per page. The information is displayed on a map using Leaflet JS, with markers indicating the location of each city and a popup displaying the weather information when clicked on.
